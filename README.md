### Guide for jTab Guitar Codeblocks

jTab Guitar Codeblocks adds the ability to show guitar chords and tabs directly in your notes.

It uses the [jTab](https://jtab.tardate.com/) library to render the chords/tabs.

#### jTab codeblocks

* ```` ```jtab````  
  jTab lines will be rendered. jTab auto-detects if chords, tabs, or both are present.
  
* ```` ```jtab-examples````  
  Type an empty codeblock to see all of the [jTab examples](https://jtab.tardate.com/examples.htm)

* ```` ```jtab-chords````  
  Type an empty codeblock to see all available chords (names only). Cut/paste anything off the list into a normal jtab codeblock to see the chord charts.

#### Enhancements specific to jTab Guitar Codeblocks
1. _Supports multiple jTab lines per codeblock_  
   Each jTab line in a codeblock will be individually rendered. Blank lines will be ignored.

2. _Supports markdown in codeblocks_  
   Lines starting with \`#&lt;space&gt;\` (\`# \`) are rendered as markdown inside the rendered codeblock

3. _Fully customizable colors in settings_  
   Choose from Normal (black on white), Themed (follows your theme's colors), or set your own custom colors for background, lines, text, chord dots, and chord dot text. Try it out in settings.

4. _Quick access to jtab-examples_  
   Change any jtab codeblock language to jtab-examples (with your jTab still inside) and it will render the examples AND preserve your jTab when you go to edit it again.

5. _Quick access to jtab-chords chord list_  
   Change any jtab codeblock language to jtab-chords (with your jTab still inside) and it will render a list of available named chords you can use AND preserve your jTab when you go to edit again.


#### jTab Color Schemes
jTab colors are now fully customizable with a Live Preview available in settings. Classic for the old-school black on white look, Themed will follow your theme colors. Start with one of those and change one color or go crazy and mix 'em up yourself with Custom.

#### Learning jTab
The [jTab Home Page](https://jtab.tardate.com/) has a [notation guide](https://jtab.tardate.com/index.htm#notation) and plenty of [examples](https://jtab.tardate.com/examples.htm).

You can put all of the examples from the jTab website directly into your notes by simply adding this:
~~~~
```jtab-examples
```

#### jTab rendering caveats
* _Is it "responsive"?_  
  The underlying jTab library isn't responsive (i.e., auto-resizing based on mobile, broswer widths) so your mileage may vary on mobile devices.

* _Rendering too wide?_  
  The width of jTab renderings are as long as you make the jTab. It's up to you to break long jTab across multiple lines.

* _What about chordonly and tabonly classes mentioned on the jTab site?_  
  The jTab library auto-detects if there are chords and/or tabs when rendering jTab. The chordonly and tabonly classes mentioned on the examples page do not affect the rendered image. They are a legacy helper classes when the rendered image's enclosing div/parent couldn't properly auto-adjust for the height of the image. With modern broswers these classes no longer needed.
